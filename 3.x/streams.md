# Streams

## Introduction

Streams are a convenient way of representing the body of an HTTP message in an object-oriented manner. 
A stream is represented with the help of the `Opis\Http\IStream` interface, 
a default implementation for this interface being provided by the library through the `Opis\Http\Stream` class.
